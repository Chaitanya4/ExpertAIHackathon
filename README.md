# ExpertAIHackathon
In todayâ€™s world, there is a huge amount of data generated every second related to different things. Due to this, we can perform analysis on data to generate useful results. Last year, when the election was held in the US, various tweets were done on Twitter related to the election. The election dataset was available at Kaggle. I have performed the sentimental analysis on that data to find the people's sentiments regarding Leader Donald Trump and Joe Biden.
The application is build using Python3, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Tensorflow, Twython, Expert.ai API, NLP.

After analyzing the data using expert.ai API, it has been found out that in the USA, over 68.4% positive sentiments were there about Donald Trump and 53.5% were there about Joe Biden.
